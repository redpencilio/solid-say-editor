# What is Solid Say editor? 

It is based on [Say-editor](https://say-editor.com/) which allows user to write documents, and enriches them with contextual data to help *computer understands what you type*. 

Solid-Say editor is an extended version of Say-editor by making it even more flexible and knowledgeable!

We follow the principles of Open Linked Data by allowing the user to add data from different sources into 
their document to enrich it with informations. These contextual informations are added in the form of [RDFa](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-primer) tags. These contextual informations are gathered straight from your [Solid](https://solid.mit.edu/) datapods! 


To get started, you should follow the [tutorial](docs/user-guide).
